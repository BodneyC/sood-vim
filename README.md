# Sood Vim

This is a language support plugin for a truly mediocre language I wrote named Sood.

For the most part, this was just to make the Sood source code a little more readable as I was developing, indent support was also a practical addition for the same purpose.

For more information about the language, please see [sood-compiler](https://github.com/BodneyC/sood-compiler).
